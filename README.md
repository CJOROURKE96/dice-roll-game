A simple dice roll game made to showcase my learning journey with C#. 

To run the application on your own machines follow these steps:

- Clone the repo to your own machine.

- Set up dotnet on your machine. This quick 5 minute tutorial will take you through the steps (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsyjpqhDp4)

- Once you have dotnet installed, along with the extension to VS code called C#. You should now be able to run commands in your terminal using dotnet. 

- Before you run any commands check out Program.cs, because this is where the code you'll be running is stored.

- The first command you should run is:
 
 dotnet build 

 This command will compile (build) the file and also let you know if there are any warnings or errors.

- If the build is succesful then you're ready to run the program. To run the program, in your terminal type:

dotnet run

- This command will then run the code in your terminal and display outputs in the terminal for you to visualise. 


Additional Info: 

- If you ever play around with the code and encounter an error that looks like this: 

attachment of code signature supplement failed

- simply run this command: 

dotnet clean

- This command will "clean" the build we previously made, meaning that the new code you've written can be compiled into a new build before you run the program again succesfully.
